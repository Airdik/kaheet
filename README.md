## Unit Test

- Having problems?
    * You can paste the script below into you browser console. NOTE: it will only work when you are on the kahoot.it site.

```ts
fetch("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EShrestha/kaheet/main/Test/testRunner.js")
.then((a) => a.text()
.then((b) => eval(b)
.then((c) => eval(c))))
```
- Kaheet should be working fine if all tests pass.
    * Ignore the red errors chrome throws, as long as all of the tests are green you're good. 
- If a test fails
    * Please submitted an issue at [Bugs or Problems](#any-bugs-or-problems) detailing what occurred.

## Bugs

Known bugs and temporary workarounds.

1. When the teacher chooses: random answers and/or random questions, the kaheet is in trouble. Highlights wrong answers and themes do not work properly. 
    * Then you should just find the correct answer by clicking ðŸ“‘ in the modes page.

2. Cheat doesn't work for private quizzes
    * No workaround at the moment, good luck!
